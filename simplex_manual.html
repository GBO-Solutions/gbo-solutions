<h1>SIMPLEX</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Linear Programming is one of the most important fields in operations research and optimization. Its goal is to determine the optimal solution to a maximization or minimization problem of a linear objective function, subject to linear constraints. It is widely used in areas such as industrial production, resource management, economic analysis, supply chain logistics, and strategic planning.</p>
<p>The Simplex algorithm, developed by George Dantzig in 1947, is the fundamental method for solving linear programming problems. It operates by moving from vertex to vertex along the feasible region of solutions, searching for the optimum. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the Simplex method has proven to be highly efficient in practice and is applied in a wide range of contexts—from production planning and transportation optimization to financial portfolio allocation and energy management.</p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is twofold: first, to present the theoretical foundations of the Simplex method with clarity and an educational perspective; and second, to support the development and application of a functional computational tool, implemented within the GBO-solutions platform. Through detailed examples and step-by-step explanations, the reader will not only gain a deep understanding of the methodology, but also acquire a complete and reliable means for solving practical linear maximization problems.</p>

<h2>2. Theory of Simplex</h2>
<h3>2.1. Standard Form of a Linear Programming Problem</h3>
<p>Linear programming is a mathematical optimization methodology aimed at determining the best possible value of a linear objective function, given a set of linear constraints. Such problems can be precisely described using systems of equations and inequalities. The general standard form of a linear programming problem is formulated as follows:</p>
<p><em>Maximize</em> z = c₁x₁ + c₂x₂ + ... + cₙxₙ<br>
<em>subject to:</em><br>
a₁₁x₁ + a₁₂x₂ + ... + a₁ₙxₙ ≤ b₁<br>
...<br>
aₘ₁x₁ + aₘ₂x₂ + ... + aₘₙxₙ ≤ bₘ<br>
x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ ≥ 0</p>
<p>
  where,
  <ul>
    <li>the variables x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are called decision variables</li>
    <li>the constants cj are the coefficients of the objective function</li>
    <li>the coefficients aij define the linear constraints of the problem</li>
    <li>and bi represent the right-hand side values of the constraints</li>
  </ul>
This formulation is well-suited for applying the Simplex method, as it enables a systematic transformation of the problem into tableau format and facilitates organized data processing.
</p>

<h3>2.2. Conversion to Standard Form</h3>
<p>In order for a linear programming problem to be solved using the Simplex method, it must first be expressed in standard form. This form requires that all constraints are written as equalities, and all variables are non-negative.
Since most real-world constraints are expressed as inequalities of the form "less than or equal to" (≤), the conversion is performed by introducing slack variables.</p>
<p>For example, the constraint: x₁+2x₂≤6 is transformed into the equivalent equation: x₁+2x₂+s₁=6, where s₁ is the slack variable, with s₁≥0.</p>
<p>The same procedure is applied to each constraint of the ≤ type, adding a different slack variable to each. In this way, the system of inequalities becomes an equivalent system of equations, enabling the construction of the initial Simplex tableau.</p>
<p>This transformation preserves the equivalence with the original problem while ensuring that all necessary conditions for the application of the method are met.</p>

<h3>2.3. Geometric Interpretation of the Method</h3>
<p>The Simplex method works by moving from one vertex to another along the edges of the feasible region, always improving (or at least not worsening) the objective function. Due to the convexity of the feasible region and the linearity of the objective function, if a maximum exists, it will occur at one of these vertices.</p>

<h3>2.4 Simplex Tableau</h3>
<p>The Simplex algorithm is typically implemented using a tabular format known as the Simplex tableau. Each iteration updates this tableau by performing pivot operations, selecting an entering and a leaving variable, and computing a new basic solution.</p>

<h3>2.5 The Algorithm</h3>
<p>The Simplex method proceeds iteratively using the following general steps:</p>
<ol type="i">
  <li>Convert the problem to standard form (add slack variables).</li>
  <li>Construct the initial Simplex tableau.</li>
  <li>Select the entering and exiting variables based on improvement criteria.</li>
  <li>Perform the pivot operation and update the tableau.</li>
</ol>
<p>The process repeats until termination is reached—when no further improvements can be made and optimality is achieved.</p>


<h2>Chapter 3: Numerical Example (Step-by-Step Solution)</h2>

<p>In this chapter, we present a detailed application of the Simplex method to a specific linear programming problem. The solution is developed step by step, following the logic of the method described in the previous chapter. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the computational process — including pivot selection and tableau transformation — as it would be carried out manually.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The example solved involves two variables and three constraints, and concludes with the optimal solution: x₁ = 2, x₂ = 3, z = 21.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Code Overview and Usage</h2>

<p>The file <code>module.py</code> provides a ready-to-use and functional tool for solving linear programming problems using the Simplex method. Its usage is simple and focuses solely on preparing the input data and interpreting the results.</p>

<pre><code>Aug = [

    [1, 1, 5]
]</code></pre>
<h4>Running the Solver</h4>
<pre><code>from module import gbo_simplex
result = gbo_simplex(Aug)</code></pre>
<h4>Output – What is returned</h4>
